Here is the complete system description for the DEVS modelization of the given problem, following the DEVS specifications:

### Atomic Model: Controller1
- **Ports:**
  - Output Port: `signal_out`
- **State Variables:**
  - `time_advance`: Initially set to 0 (to allow immediate transitions).
  - `state`: Initially set to `off` (indicating the light is off).
- **Transition Functions:**
  - **Internal Transition Function (delta_int):**
    - Toggle `state` between `on` and `off`.
    - Set `time_advance` to 1 second (to schedule the next toggle).
  - **External Transition Function (delta_ext):**
    - Not applicable for this model since it does not receive any messages.
  - **Output Function (lambda_out):**
    - Send the current `state` (either `on` or `off`) to `signal_out` after the internal transition.
  - **Confluent Transition Function (delta_conf):**
    - Execute the internal transition function and output function if a message arrives at the same time.

### Atomic Model: Controller2
- **Ports:**
  - Output Port: `signal_out`
- **State Variables:**
  - `time_advance`: Initially set to 0 (to allow immediate transitions).
  - `state`: Initially set to `off` (indicating the light is off).
- **Transition Functions:**
  - **Internal Transition Function (delta_int):**
    - Toggle `state` between `on` and `off`.
    - Set `time_advance` to 2 seconds (to schedule the next toggle).
  - **External Transition Function (delta_ext):**
    - Not applicable for this model since it does not receive any messages.
  - **Output Function (lambda_out):**
    - Send the current `state` (either `on` or `off`) to `signal_out` after the internal transition.
  - **Confluent Transition Function (delta_conf):**
    - Execute the internal transition function and output function if a message arrives at the same time.

### Atomic Model: Controller3
- **Ports:**
  - Output Port: `signal_out`
- **State Variables:**
  - `time_advance`: Initially set to 0 (to allow immediate transitions).
  - `state`: Initially set to `off` (indicating the light is off).
- **Transition Functions:**
  - **Internal Transition Function (delta_int):**
    - Toggle `state` between `on` and `off`.
    - Set `time_advance` to 3 seconds (to schedule the next toggle).
  - **External Transition Function (delta_ext):**
    - Not applicable for this model since it does not receive any messages.
  - **Output Function (lambda_out):**
    - Send the current `state` (either `on` or `off`) to `signal_out` after the internal transition.
  - **Confluent Transition Function (delta_conf):**
    - Execute the internal transition function and output function if a message arrives at the same time.

### Atomic Model: Controller4
- **Ports:**
  - Output Port: `signal_out`
- **State Variables:**
  - `time_advance`: Initially set to 0 (to allow immediate transitions).
  - `state`: Initially set to `off` (indicating the light is off).
- **Transition Functions:**
  - **Internal Transition Function (delta_int):**
    - Toggle `state` between `on` and `off`.
    - Set `time_advance` to 4 seconds (to schedule the next toggle).
  - **External Transition Function (delta_ext):**
    - Not applicable for this model since it does not receive any messages.
  - **Output Function (lambda_out):**
    - Send the current `state` (either `on` or `off`) to `signal_out` after the internal transition.
  - **Confluent Transition Function (delta_conf):**
    - Execute the internal transition function and output function if a message arrives at the same time.

### Atomic Model: Controller5
- **Ports:**
  - Output Port: `signal_out`
- **State Variables:**
  - `time_advance`: Initially set to 0 (to allow immediate transitions).
  - `state`: Initially set to `off` (indicating the light is off).
- **Transition Functions:**
  - **Internal Transition Function (delta_int):**
    - Toggle `state` between `on` and `off`.
    - Set `time_advance` to 5 seconds (to schedule the next toggle).
  - **External Transition Function (delta_ext):**
    - Not applicable for this model since it does not receive any messages.
  - **Output Function (lambda_out):**
    - Send the current `state` (either `on` or `off`) to `signal_out` after the internal transition.
  - **Confluent Transition Function (delta_conf):**
    - Execute the internal transition function and output function if a message arrives at the same time.

### Important Notes
- Each controller auto-starts its toggling cycle 10 seconds after the simulation starts.
- The `time_advance` for each controller is set to the respective frequency (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 seconds) to ensure the correct timing for toggling the light.
- Ensure that the `time_advance` values are properly managed to avoid any infinite loops.
