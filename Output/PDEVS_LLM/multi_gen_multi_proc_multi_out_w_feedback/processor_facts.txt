- **ports:**
  - input ports: `in_1`, `in_2`
  - output ports: `out_1`, `out_2`
- **state variables:**
  - `time_advance`: initially set to 2 (the processing time).
  - `state`: initially set to `idle` (indicating the processor is not busy).
  - `job_queue`: a queue to hold incoming jobs.
- **transition functions:**
  - **internal transition function (delta_int):**
    - if there are no jobs in the queue, set `state` to `idle`.
    - if there are jobs, process the next job, and if the queue is not empty, set `time_advance` to 2.
  - **external transition function (delta_ext):**
    - add incoming jobs from `in_1` and `in_2` to the job queue.
    - if jobs are added and the state is `idle`, set `state` to `busy` and `time_advance` to 2.
  - **output function (lambda_out):**
    - send the processed job to `out_1` if it was from `in_1` and to `out_2` if it was from `in_2`.
  - **confluent transition function (delta_conf):**
    - if jobs arrive while processing, add to the queue and continue processing the current job.
