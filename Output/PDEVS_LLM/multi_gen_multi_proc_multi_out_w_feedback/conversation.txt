    "content": "You are a StateChart developer using the given detailed Atomic model description. Your goal is to develop the statechart for the behavior of an atomic model using a structured grammar. This grammar is designed to model Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS) components, capturing their states, transitions, and functions. The specification follows a rule-based structure that enables precise and consistent definitions of atomic model behavior. \n\n# Syntax and Semantics\n- The `AtomicModel` class has the attribute `ConfluentType` to define confluent function\n- States in DEVS are defined using four classes - `InitialState`, `State`, `CompositeState`, and `FinalState`\n- `InternalTransition` and `ExternalTransition` classes capture the Internal Transition Fuction and External Transition function, respectively\n- `Transition` class is used to initialize the model which starts from `InitialState`\n- `OutputFunction` class defines the output function of DEVS that just can be added to the `State`. \n\nEach class has the fixed properties associated with them to model the behaviour. \n- `Action` property lists the actions to be taken if the condition from `Guard` property is true.\n- `Guard` property lists the conditions to be met to complete the state transition. If `Guard` property is (\"\") it is to be considered true by default.\n- `Source` property stores the value of the source state of the transition.\n- `Target` property stores the value of the target state of the transition.\n- `TimeAdvanceType` property stores the type of Time Advance amongst Infinity, Update and Value. \n- `TimeAdvanceValue` property stores the value of the Time Advance as float. If `TimeAdvanceType` stores Infinity, then `TimeAdvanceValue` should set to 0.0.\n- `InputPort` property stores the Input port name which triggers the corresponding `ExternalTransition`. \n- `OutputPort` property stores the Output port name which outputs the Message once `InternalTransition` occurs. \n-  `Message` property stores the message to be expected at the `InputPort` in case of `ExternalTransition` class and message to be produced at `OutputPort` in case of `InternalTransition` class. \n- `Description` property stores the description of the parent class. \n\n# Grammar to

`Transition`, `ExternalTransition`, `InternalTransition`) only sets state or time advance or both.\n- You should always follow the standard statechart convetion for the `Guard` and `Action` entrires, i.e ObjectofInterest.\nOperationorFunctiontobePerformed\n    Example:\n    `q.remove()` -> here `q` is the object to perform operation/function on and `remove()` is the operation or function to be performed.\n- Include all the properties in the class. You can leave the empty string (\"\") if that property is not to be used in the class definition. For instance, if a particular transititon only has a `Guard` condition and there is no need to perform any action, then you can store \"\" in `Action` property of the corresponding class.\n- Don't miss to include the model initialization in the `Action` property of the `Transition` class as per model requirements. For instance, in the processor with queue example used queue to hold the jobs, thus the queue is initialized in the `Transition` class through `Action` property\n\nTHINK STEP BY STEP AND ACCURATELY DEFINE CLASSES AND PROPERTIES. MAKE SURE TO FOLLOW THE RESTRICTIONS WITH `Action` PROPERTY CORRECTLY. STRICTLY NO NEED FOR THE EXPLANATION. JUST PROVIDE THE MODEL. NO ADDITIONAL TEXT IS NEEDED."

`idle`.\n    - If there are jobs, process the next job, and if the queue is not empty, set `time_advance` to 2.\n  - **External Transition Function (delta_ext):**\n    - Add incoming jobs from `in_1` and `in_2` to the job queue.\n    - If jobs are added and the state is `idle`, set `state` to `busy` and `time_advance` to 2.\n  - **Output Function (lambda_out):**\n    - Send the processed job to `out_1` if it was from `in_1` and to `out_2` if it was from `in_2`.\n  - **Confluent Transition Function (delta_conf):**\n    - If jobs arrive while processing, add to the queue and continue processing the current job.\n\n### Atomic Model: Sensor_A\n- **Ports:**\n  - Input Port: `in`\n  - Output Port: `out`\n- **State Variables:**\n  - `job_count`: Initially set to 0 (to count the processed jobs).\n- **Transition Functions:**\n  - **Internal Transition Function (delta_int):**\n    - Not applicable since this model waits for incoming jobs.\n  - **External Transition Function (delta_ext):**\n    - Increment `job_count` for each processed job received at `in`.\n    - If `job_count` reaches 5, send a stop signal on `out` to stop `Generator_A`.\n  - **Output Function (lambda_out):**\n    - Send a stop signal to `out` when `job_count` reaches 5.\n  - **Confluent Transition Function (delta_conf):**\n    - Not applicable since this model only reacts to incoming jobs.\n\n### Atomic Model: Sensor_B\n- **Ports:**\n  - Input Port: `in`\n  - Output Port: `out`\n- **State Variables:**\n  - `job_count`: Initially set to 0 (to count the processed jobs).\n- **Transition Functions:**\n  - **Internal Transition Function (delta_int):**\n    - Not applicable since this model waits for incoming jobs.\n  - **External Transition Function (delta_ext):**\n    - Increment `job_count` for each processed job received at `in`.\n    - If `job_count` reaches 5, send a stop signal on `out` to stop `Generator_B`.\n  - **Output Function (lambda_out):**\n    - Send a stop signal to `out` when `job_count` reaches 5.\n  - **Confluent Transition Function (delta_conf):**\n    - Not applicable since this model only reacts to incoming jobs.\n\n### Important Notes\n- Ensure that the `time_advance` for both `Generator_A` and `Generator_B` is properly set to avoid infinite loops.\n- The `Processor` must handle jobs in a way to prevent its `time_advance` from being set to 0 unless it is transitioning to `idle`.\n- The `lambda` keyword has been avoided in the output function naming.\n\nCreated atomic models:{'generator_a': 'Model {\\n    ConfluentType = FIT\\n\\n

`out`\n- **state variables:**\n  - `job_count`: initially set to 0 (to count the processed jobs).\n- **transition functions:**\n  - **internal transition function (delta_int):**\n    - not applicable since this model waits for incoming jobs.\n  - **external transition function (delta_ext):**\n    - increment `job_count` for each processed job received at `in`.\n    - if `job_count` reaches 5, send a stop signal on `out` to stop `generator_b`.\n  - **output function (lambda_out):**\n    - send a stop signal to `out` when `job_count` reaches 5.\n  - **confluent transition function (delta_conf):**\n    - not applicable since this model only reacts to incoming jobs..\n\nMake sure to use relevant inport and outports to establish the proper connectivity in the coupled models."
