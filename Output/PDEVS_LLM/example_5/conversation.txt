    "content": "You are a StateChart developer using the given detailed Atomic model description. Your goal is to develop the statechart for the behavior of an atomic model using a structured grammar. This grammar is designed to model Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS) components, capturing their states, transitions, and functions. The specification follows a rule-based structure that enables precise and consistent definitions of atomic model behavior. \n\n# Syntax and Semantics\n- The `AtomicModel` class has the attribute `ConfluentType` to define confluent function\n- States in DEVS are defined using four classes - `InitialState`, `State`, `CompositeState`, and `FinalState`\n- `InternalTransition` and `ExternalTransition` classes capture the Internal Transition Fuction and External Transition function, respectively\n- `Transition` class is used to initialize the model which starts from `InitialState`\n- `OutputFunction` class defines the output function of DEVS that just can be added to the `State`. \n\nEach class has the fixed properties associated with them to model the behaviour. \n- `Action` property lists the actions to be taken if the condition from `Guard` property is true.\n- `Guard` property lists the conditions to be met to complete the state transition. If `Guard` property is (\"\") it is to be considered true by default.\n- `Source` property stores the value of the source state of the transition.\n- `Target` property stores the value of the target state of the transition.\n- `TimeAdvanceType` property stores the type of Time Advance amongst Infinity, Update and Value. \n- `TimeAdvanceValue` property stores the value of the Time Advance as float. If `TimeAdvanceType` stores Infinity, then `TimeAdvanceValue` should set to 0.0.\n- `InputPort` property stores the Input port name which triggers the corresponding `ExternalTransition`. \n- `OutputPort` property stores the Output port name which outputs the Message once `InternalTransition` occurs. \n-  `Message` property stores the message to be expected at the `InputPort` in case of `ExternalTransition` class and message to be produced at `OutputPort` in case of `InternalTransition` class. \n- `Description` property stores the description of the parent class. \n\n# Grammar to

`Transition`, `ExternalTransition`, `InternalTransition`) only sets state or time advance or both.\n- You should always follow the standard statechart convetion for the `Guard` and `Action` entrires, i.e ObjectofInterest.\nOperationorFunctiontobePerformed\n    Example:\n    `q.remove()` -> here `q` is the object to perform operation/function on and `remove()` is the operation or function to be performed.\n- Include all the properties in the class. You can leave the empty string (\"\") if that property is not to be used in the class definition. For instance, if a particular transititon only has a `Guard` condition and there is no need to perform any action, then you can store \"\" in `Action` property of the corresponding class.\n- Don't miss to include the model initialization in the `Action` property of the `Transition` class as per model requirements. For instance, in the processor with queue example used queue to hold the jobs, thus the queue is initialized in the `Transition` class through `Action` property\n\nTHINK STEP BY STEP AND ACCURATELY DEFINE CLASSES AND PROPERTIES. MAKE SURE TO FOLLOW THE RESTRICTIONS WITH `Action` PROPERTY CORRECTLY. STRICTLY NO NEED FOR THE EXPLANATION. JUST PROVIDE THE MODEL. NO ADDITIONAL TEXT IS NEEDED."

    "content": "The overall system facts:\n\nHere is the complete system description for the DEVS modelization of the given problem, following the DEVS specifications:\n\n### Coupled Model: Light\n- This is the coupled model that contains the details about the Light and Sensor system.\n- **Ports:**\n  - Input Port: `control_in`\n  - Output Port: `status_out`\n- **Internal Couplings:**\n  - The output port of `Light` component is connected to the input port of `Sensor`.\n- **External Couplings:**\n  - The `control_in` port of the `Light` coupled model is connected to the output port of the `Controller` component.\n  - The output port of the `Sensor` component is connected to the `status_out` port of the `Light` coupled model.\n\n### Atomic Model: Controller\n- **Ports:**\n  - Output Port: `control_out`\n- **State Variables:**\n  - `time_advance`: Initially set to 10 (to delay the start of sending commands).\n  - `state`: Initially set to `inactive` (indicating the controller has not started sending signals).\n- **Transition Functions:**\n  - **Internal Transition Function (delta_int):**\n    - Change `state` to `active`.\n    - Set `time_advance` to 1 (to send signals every second).\n  - **External Transition Function (delta_ext):**\n    - Not applicable for this model since it does not receive any messages.\n  - **Output Function (lambda_out):**\n    - Send an \"on\" signal to `control_out` when transitioning from `inactive` to `active`.\n    - Alternate sending \"on\" and \"off\" signals every second while in the `active` state.\n  - **Confluent Transition Function (delta_conf):**\n    - If a message arrives while in the `inactive` state, execute the internal transition function and output function immediately.\n\n### Atomic Model: Light\n- **Ports:**\n  - Input Port: `control_in`\n  - Output Port: `status_out`\n- **State Variables:**\n  - `time_advance`: Initially set to 0 (to allow immediate transitions).\n  - `state`: Initially set to `off` (indicating the light is off).\n- **Transition Functions:**\n  - **Internal Transition Function (delta_int):**\n    - Toggle the `state` between `on` and `off`.\n    - Set `time_advance` to 1 (to prepare for the next toggle).\n  - **External Transition Function (delta_ext):**\n    - If a control signal is received at `control_in`, set the `state` to \"on\" if currently \"off\", and to \"off\" if currently \"on\".\n    - Set `time_advance` to 1 (to prepare for the next toggle).\n  - **Output Function (lambda_out):**\n    - Send the current `state` (\"on\" or \"off\") to `status_out` after each toggle.\n  - **Confluent Transition Function (delta_conf):**\n    - If a control signal is received while toggling, process the control signal and toggle the state immediately.\n\n### Atomic Model: Sensor\n- **Ports:**\n  - Input Port: `light_status_in`\n  - Output Port: `status_out`\n- **State Variables:**\n  - `time_advance`: Initially set to 0 (to allow immediate transitions).\n  - `state`: Initially set to `off` (indicating the sensor detects the light is off).\n- **Transition Functions:**\n  - **Internal Transition Function (delta_int):**\n    - No state change, retains the last known state.\n    - Set `time_advance` to 0 (to allow immediate transitions).\n  - **External Transition Function (delta_ext):**\n    - If a light status signal is received at `light_status_in`, update `state` to match the incoming signal (\"on\" or \"off\").\n  - **Output Function (lambda_out):**\n    - Send the current `state` (\"on\" or \"off\") to `status_out` immediately after receiving a signal.\n  - **Confluent Transition Function (delta_conf):**\n    - If a light status signal is received while in the middle of processing, update the state immediately.\n\n### Summary of Execution Flow\n1. The `Controller` waits for 10 seconds before sending an \"on\" signal.\n2. After the initial signal, the `Controller` alternates between sending \"on\" and \"off\" signals every second.\n3. The `Light` receives the control signals and toggles its state accordingly.\n4. The `Sensor` detects the current state of the `Light` and sends updates on its status.\n\n### Important Notes\n- Ensure that the `time_advance` for the `Controller` is properly set to avoid an infinite loop.\n- The `Light` must not set its `time_advance` to 0 unless it is transitioning to toggle its state, to avoid infinite loops.\n- The `lambda` keyword has been avoided in the output function naming.\n\nCreated atomic models:{'controller': 'Model {\\n    ConfluentType = FET\\n\\n    // States\\n    InitialState { Name = \"start\" }\\n\\n    State { \\n        Name = \"inactive\"\\n    }\\n\\n    State { \\n        Name = \"active\"\\n        OutputFunction {\\n            Action = \"toggleSignal()\"\\n            Description = \"Alternates signals between \\'on\\' and \\'off\\' every second\"\\n            Guard = \"\" \\n            Message = \"control_out\" \\n            OutputPort = \"control_out\"\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n    // Transitions\\n    Transition {  \\n        Action = \"time_advance=10\"\\n        Description = \"Initializing the model\"\\n        Source = \"start\"  \\n        Target = \"inactive\" \\n        TimeAdvanceType = Value\\n        TimeAdvanceValue = 10.0\\n    }\\n\\n    InternalTransition {\\n        Action = \"state=\\'active\\';
