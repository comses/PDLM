- **ports:**
  - output port: `control_out`
- **state variables:**
  - `time_advance`: initially set to 10 (to delay the start of sending commands).
  - `state`: initially set to `inactive` (indicating the controller has not started sending signals).
- **transition functions:**
  - **internal transition function (delta_int):**
    - change `state` to `active`.
    - set `time_advance` to 1 (to send signals every second).
  - **external transition function (delta_ext):**
    - not applicable for this model since it does not receive any messages.
  - **output function (lambda_out):**
    - send an "on" signal to `control_out` when transitioning from `inactive` to `active`.
    - alternate sending "on" and "off" signals every second while in the `active` state.
  - **confluent transition function (delta_conf):**
    - if a message arrives while in the `inactive` state, execute the internal transition function and output function immediately.
