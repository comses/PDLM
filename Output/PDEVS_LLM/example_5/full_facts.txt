Here is the complete system description for the DEVS modelization of the given problem, following the DEVS specifications:

### Coupled Model: Light
- This is the coupled model that contains the details about the Light and Sensor system.
- **Ports:**
  - Input Port: `control_in`
  - Output Port: `status_out`
- **Internal Couplings:**
  - The output port of `Light` component is connected to the input port of `Sensor`.
- **External Couplings:**
  - The `control_in` port of the `Light` coupled model is connected to the output port of the `Controller` component.
  - The output port of the `Sensor` component is connected to the `status_out` port of the `Light` coupled model.

### Atomic Model: Controller
- **Ports:**
  - Output Port: `control_out`
- **State Variables:**
  - `time_advance`: Initially set to 10 (to delay the start of sending commands).
  - `state`: Initially set to `inactive` (indicating the controller has not started sending signals).
- **Transition Functions:**
  - **Internal Transition Function (delta_int):**
    - Change `state` to `active`.
    - Set `time_advance` to 1 (to send signals every second).
  - **External Transition Function (delta_ext):**
    - Not applicable for this model since it does not receive any messages.
  - **Output Function (lambda_out):**
    - Send an "on" signal to `control_out` when transitioning from `inactive` to `active`.
    - Alternate sending "on" and "off" signals every second while in the `active` state.
  - **Confluent Transition Function (delta_conf):**
    - If a message arrives while in the `inactive` state, execute the internal transition function and output function immediately.

### Atomic Model: Light
- **Ports:**
  - Input Port: `control_in`
  - Output Port: `status_out`
- **State Variables:**
  - `time_advance`: Initially set to 0 (to allow immediate transitions).
  - `state`: Initially set to `off` (indicating the light is off).
- **Transition Functions:**
  - **Internal Transition Function (delta_int):**
    - Toggle the `state` between `on` and `off`.
    - Set `time_advance` to 1 (to prepare for the next toggle).
  - **External Transition Function (delta_ext):**
    - If a control signal is received at `control_in`, set the `state` to "on" if currently "off", and to "off" if currently "on".
    - Set `time_advance` to 1 (to prepare for the next toggle).
  - **Output Function (lambda_out):**
    - Send the current `state` ("on" or "off") to `status_out` after each toggle.
  - **Confluent Transition Function (delta_conf):**
    - If a control signal is received while toggling, process the control signal and toggle the state immediately.

### Atomic Model: Sensor
- **Ports:**
  - Input Port: `light_status_in`
  - Output Port: `status_out`
- **State Variables:**
  - `time_advance`: Initially set to 0 (to allow immediate transitions).
  - `state`: Initially set to `off` (indicating the sensor detects the light is off).
- **Transition Functions:**
  - **Internal Transition Function (delta_int):**
    - No state change, retains the last known state.
    - Set `time_advance` to 0 (to allow immediate transitions).
  - **External Transition Function (delta_ext):**
    - If a light status signal is received at `light_status_in`, update `state` to match the incoming signal ("on" or "off").
  - **Output Function (lambda_out):**
    - Send the current `state` ("on" or "off") to `status_out` immediately after receiving a signal.
  - **Confluent Transition Function (delta_conf):**
    - If a light status signal is received while in the middle of processing, update the state immediately.

### Summary of Execution Flow
1. The `Controller` waits for 10 seconds before sending an "on" signal.
2. After the initial signal, the `Controller` alternates between sending "on" and "off" signals every second.
3. The `Light` receives the control signals and toggles its state accordingly.
4. The `Sensor` detects the current state of the `Light` and sends updates on its status.

### Important Notes
- Ensure that the `time_advance` for the `Controller` is properly set to avoid an infinite loop.
- The `Light` must not set its `time_advance` to 0 unless it is transitioning to toggle its state, to avoid infinite loops.
- The `lambda` keyword has been avoided in the output function naming.
