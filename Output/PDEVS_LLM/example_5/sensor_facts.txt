- **ports:**
  - input port: `light_status_in`
  - output port: `status_out`
- **state variables:**
  - `time_advance`: initially set to 0 (to allow immediate transitions).
  - `state`: initially set to `off` (indicating the sensor detects the light is off).
- **transition functions:**
  - **internal transition function (delta_int):**
    - no state change, retains the last known state.
    - set `time_advance` to 0 (to allow immediate transitions).
  - **external transition function (delta_ext):**
    - if a light status signal is received at `light_status_in`, update `state` to match the incoming signal ("on" or "off").
  - **output function (lambda_out):**
    - send the current `state` ("on" or "off") to `status_out` immediately after receiving a signal.
  - **confluent transition function (delta_conf):**
    - if a light status signal is received while in the middle of processing, update the state immediately.
