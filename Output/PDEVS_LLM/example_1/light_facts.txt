- **ports:**
  - input port: `signal_in`
- **state variables:**
  - `state`: initially set to `off` (indicating the light is off).
- **transition functions:**
  - **internal transition function (delta_int):**
    - not applicable as the light state changes based on the incoming signal.
  - **external transition function (delta_ext):**
    - if an `on` signal is received at `signal_in`, change `state` to `on`.
    - if an `off` signal is received at `signal_in`, change `state` to `off`.
  - **output function (lambda_out):**
    - not applicable as the light does not output signals.
  - **confluent transition function (delta_conf):**
    - not applicable as the light state changes based solely on incoming signals.
