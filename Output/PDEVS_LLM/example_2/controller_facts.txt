- **ports:**
  - output port: `signal_out`
- **state variables:**
  - `time_advance`: initially set to 10 (to start the toggling after 10 seconds).
  - `state`: initially set to `idle` (indicating the controller is not sending signals).
- **transition functions:**
  - **internal transition function (delta_int):**
    - change `state` to `idle`.
    - set `time_advance` to 1 (to toggle every second).
  - **external transition function (delta_ext):**
    - not applicable for this model since it does not receive any messages.
  - **output function (lambda_out):**
    - send an "on" signal to `signal_out` when transitioning from `idle` to active state (after 10 seconds).
    - toggle between "on" and "off" signals every second thereafter.
  - **confluent transition function (delta_conf):**
    - execute the internal transition function and output function if a message arrives at the same time.
