Here is the complete system description for the DEVS modelization of the given problem, following the DEVS specifications:

### Coupled Model: Controller-Lights
- This is the coupled model that contains the details about the Controller and the five Lights system.
- **Ports:**
  - Input Port: None (as this is the overall system and there is no hierarchy above this.)
  - Output Port: None (as this is the overall system and there is no hierarchy above this.)
- **Internal Couplings:**
  - The output port of the `Controller` component is connected to the input ports of `Light1`, `Light2`, `Light3`, `Light4`, and `Light5`.
- **External Couplings:**
  - None (as there are no Ports for this coupled model).

### Atomic Model: Controller
- **Ports:**
  - Output Port: `signal_out`
- **State Variables:**
  - `time_advance`: Initially set to 10 (to start the toggling after 10 seconds).
  - `state`: Initially set to `idle` (indicating the controller is not sending signals).
- **Transition Functions:**
  - **Internal Transition Function (delta_int):**
    - Change `state` to `idle`.
    - Set `time_advance` to 1 (to toggle every second).
  - **External Transition Function (delta_ext):**
    - Not applicable for this model since it does not receive any messages.
  - **Output Function (lambda_out):**
    - Send an "on" signal to `signal_out` when transitioning from `idle` to active state (after 10 seconds).
    - Toggle between "on" and "off" signals every second thereafter.
  - **Confluent Transition Function (delta_conf):**
    - Execute the internal transition function and output function if a message arrives at the same time.

### Atomic Model: Light1
- **Ports:**
  - Input Port: `signal_in`
  - Output Port: `status_out`
- **State Variables:**
  - `time_advance`: Initially set to 0 (to allow immediate transitions).

    - Change `state` to `off` if it receives an "off" signal, or to `on` if it receives an "on" signal.
    - Set `time_advance` to 0 (to allow immediate processing of the next signal).
  - **External Transition Function (delta_ext):**
    - If a signal is received at `signal_in`, change `state` to `on` if the signal is "on", or to `off` if the signal is "off".
  - **Output Function (lambda_out):**
    - Send the current state (`on` or `off`) to `status_out` whenever the state changes.

### Summary of Execution Flow
1. The `Controller` starts sending signals after 10 seconds, toggling between "on" and "off" every second.
2. Each `Light` component (`Light1`, `Light2`, `Light3`, `Light4`, `Light5`) receives the signal from the `Controller` and updates its state accordingly.
3. Each `Light` outputs its current state whenever it changes.

### Important Notes
- Ensure that the `time_advance` for the `Controller` is properly set to avoid an infinite loop.
- The `Light` components must not set their `time_advance` to 0 unless they are transitioning to prevent infinite loops.
- The `lambda` keyword has been avoided in the output function naming.
