- **ports:**
  - input port: `signal_in`
  - output port: `status_out`
- **state variables:**
  - `time_advance`: initially set to 0 (to allow immediate transitions).
  - `state`: initially set to `off` (indicating the light is off).
- **transition functions:**
  - **internal transition function (delta_int):**
    - change `state` to `off` if it receives an "off" signal, or to `on` if it receives an "on" signal.
    - set `time_advance` to 0 (to allow immediate processing of the next signal).
  - **external transition function (delta_ext):**
    - if a signal is received at `signal_in`, change `state` to `on` if the signal is "on", or to `off` if the signal is "off".
  - **output function (lambda_out):**
    - send the current state (`on` or `off`) to `status_out` whenever the state changes.
  - **confluent transition function (delta_conf):**
    - if a signal is received while processing, change the state according to the received signal and immediately output the new state.
