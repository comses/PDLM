    "content": "You are a StateChart developer using the given detailed Atomic model description. Your goal is to develop the statechart for the behavior of an atomic model using a structured grammar. This grammar is designed to model Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS) components, capturing their states, transitions, and functions. The specification follows a rule-based structure that enables precise and consistent definitions of atomic model behavior. \n\n# Syntax and Semantics\n- The `AtomicModel` class has the attribute `ConfluentType` to define confluent function\n- States in DEVS are defined using four classes - `InitialState`, `State`, `CompositeState`, and `FinalState`\n- `InternalTransition` and `ExternalTransition` classes capture the Internal Transition Fuction and External Transition function, respectively\n- `Transition` class is used to initialize the model which starts from `InitialState`\n- `OutputFunction` class defines the output function of DEVS that just can be added to the `State`. \n\nEach class has the fixed properties associated with them to model the behaviour. \n- `Action` property lists the actions to be taken if the condition from `Guard` property is true.\n- `Guard` property lists the conditions to be met to complete the state transition. If `Guard` property is (\"\") it is to be considered true by default.\n- `Source` property stores the value of the source state of the transition.\n- `Target` property stores the value of the target state of the transition.\n- `TimeAdvanceType` property stores the type of Time Advance amongst Infinity, Update and Value. \n- `TimeAdvanceValue` property stores the value of the Time Advance as float. If `TimeAdvanceType` stores Infinity, then `TimeAdvanceValue` should set to 0.0.\n- `InputPort` property stores the Input port name which triggers the corresponding `ExternalTransition`. \n- `OutputPort` property stores the Output port name which outputs the Message once `InternalTransition` occurs. \n-  `Message` property stores the message to be expected at the `InputPort` in case of `ExternalTransition` class and message to be produced at `OutputPort` in case of `InternalTransition` class. \n- `Description` property stores the description of the parent class. \n\n# Grammar to

`Transition`, `ExternalTransition`, `InternalTransition`) only sets state or time advance or both.\n- You should always follow the standard statechart convetion for the `Guard` and `Action` entrires, i.e ObjectofInterest.\nOperationorFunctiontobePerformed\n    Example:\n    `q.remove()` -> here `q` is the object to perform operation/function on and `remove()` is the operation or function to be performed.\n- Include all the properties in the class. You can leave the empty string (\"\") if that property is not to be used in the class definition. For instance, if a particular transititon only has a `Guard` condition and there is no need to perform any action, then you can store \"\" in `Action` property of the corresponding class.\n- Don't miss to include the model initialization in the `Action` property of the `Transition` class as per model requirements. For instance, in the processor with queue example used queue to hold the jobs, thus the queue is initialized in the `Transition` class through `Action` property\n\nTHINK STEP BY STEP AND ACCURATELY DEFINE CLASSES AND PROPERTIES. MAKE SURE TO FOLLOW THE RESTRICTIONS WITH `Action` PROPERTY CORRECTLY. STRICTLY NO NEED FOR THE EXPLANATION. JUST PROVIDE THE MODEL. NO ADDITIONAL TEXT IS NEEDED."

The `Light` toggles its state between `on` and `off` and sends the current state to the `Sensor`.\n3. The `Sensor` counts the number of toggles and sends a stop signal to the `Controller` after 10 cycles.\n4. Upon receiving the stop signal, the `Controller` will turn off the `Light` and stop sending further commands.\n\n### Important Notes\n- Ensure that the `time_advance` for the `Light` is properly set to avoid an infinite loop.\n- The `Sensor` must not set its `time_advance` to 0 unless it is transitioning to a final state to avoid infinite loops.\n- The `lambda` keyword has been avoided in the output function naming.\n\nCreated atomic models:{'light': 'Model {\\n    ConfluentType = FIT\\n\\n    // States\\n    InitialState { Name = \"start\" }\\n\\n    State { \\n        Name = \"off\"\\n        OutputFunction {\\n            Action = \"send(state)\"\\n            Description = \"Send the current state to light_status_out\"\\n            Guard = \"\" \\n            Message = \"off\" \\n            OutputPort = \"light_status_out\"\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n    State { \\n        Name = \"on\"\\n        OutputFunction {\\n            Action = \"send(state)\"\\n            Description = \"Send the current state to light_status_out\"\\n            Guard = \"\"\\n            Message = \"on\" \\n            OutputPort = \"light_status_out\"\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n    // Transitions\\n    Transition {  \\n        Action = \"time_advance=1,state=off\"\\n        Description = \"Initializing the model\"\\n        Source = \"start\"  \\n        Target = \"off\" \\n        TimeAdvanceType = Value\\n        TimeAdvanceValue = 1.0\\n    }\\n\\n    InternalTransition {\\n        Action = \"toggle(state),time_advance=1\"\\n        Description = \"Toggle state between on and off\"\\n        Guard = \"\" \\n        Source = \"on\"  \\n        Target = \"off\"  \\n        TimeAdvanceType = Value  \\n        TimeAdvanceValue = 1.0\\n    }\\n\\n    InternalTransition {\\n        Action = \"toggle(state),time_advance=1\"\\n        Description = \"Toggle state between off and on\"\\n        Guard = \"\" \\n        Source = \"off\"  \\n        Target = \"on\"  \\n        TimeAdvanceType = Value  \\n        TimeAdvanceValue = 1.0\\n    }\\n\\n    ExternalTransition {\\n        Action = \"toggle(state),time_advance=1\"\\n        Description = \"Toggle state based on control signal\"\\n        Guard = \"\"\\n        InputPort = \"control_in\"\\n        Message = \"\"\\n        Source = \"off\"  \\n        Target = \"on\"  \\n        TimeAdvanceType = Value\\n        TimeAdvanceValue = 1.0\\n    }\\n\\n    ExternalTransition {\\n        Action = \"toggle(state),time_advance=1\"\\n        Description = \"Toggle state based on control signal\"\\n        Guard = \"\"\\n        InputPort = \"control_in\"\\n        Message = \"\"\\n        Source = \"on\"  \\n        Target = \"off\"  \\n        TimeAdvanceType = Value\\n        TimeAdvanceValue = 1.0\\n    }\\n}'}\n\nFacts for atomic model to be created:\n\n- **ports:**\n  - input port: `light_status_in`\n  - output port: `stop_signal_out`\n- **state variables:**\n  - `time_advance`: initially set to infinity (waiting for light status).\n  - `toggle_count`: initially set to 0 (to count the number of cycles).\n- **transition functions:**\n  - **internal transition function (delta_int):**\n    - not applicable as the sensor is waiting for input.\n  - **external transition function (delta_ext):**\n    - if a light status is received at `light_status_in`, increment `toggle_count`.\n    - if `toggle_count` reaches 10, send a stop signal through `stop_signal_out` and set `time_advance` to infinity.\n  - **output function (lambda_out):**\n    - send a stop signal to `stop_signal_out` when `toggle_count` reaches 10.\n  - **confluent transition function (delta_conf):**\n    - execute the external transition function and output function if a message arrives at the same time..\n\nMake sure to use relevant inport and outports to establish the proper connectivity in the coupled models."
