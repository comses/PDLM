Here is the complete system description for the DEVS modelization of the given problem, following the DEVS specifications:

### Coupled Model: Light-Sensor
- This is the coupled model that contains the details about the Light-Sensor system.
- **Ports:**
  - Input Port: `in`
  - Output Port: `out`
- **Internal Couplings:**
  - The output port of the `Light` component is connected to the input port of the `Sensor`.
- **External Couplings:**
  - The `in` port of the `Light-Sensor` coupled model is connected to the input port of the `Light` component.
  - The output port of the `Sensor` component is connected to the `out` port of the `Light-Sensor` component.

### Atomic Model: Light
- **Ports:**
  - Input Port: `control_in`
  - Output Port: `light_status_out`
- **State Variables:**
  - `time_advance`: Initially set to 1 (to allow toggling every second).
  - `state`: Initially set to `off` (indicating the light is off).
- **Transition Functions:**
  - **Internal Transition Function (delta_int):**
    - Toggle the `state` between `on` and `off`.
    - Set `time_advance` to 1 (to prepare for the next toggle).
  - **External Transition Function (delta_ext):**
    - If a control signal is received at `control_in`, toggle the `state` accordingly.
  - **Output Function (lambda_out):**
    - Send the current `state` to `light_status_out` whenever the state changes.
  - **Confluent Transition Function (delta_conf):**
    - Execute the internal transition function and output function if a message arrives at the same time.

### Atomic Model: Sensor
- **Ports:**
  - Input Port: `light_status_in`
  - Output Port: `stop_signal_out`
- **State Variables:**
  - `time_advance`: Initially set to infinity (waiting for light status).
  - `toggle_count`: Initially set to 0 (to count the number of cycles).
- **Transition Functions:**
  - **Internal Transition Function (delta_int):**
    - Not applicable as the sensor is waiting for input.
  - **External Transition Function (delta_ext):**
    - If a light status is received at `light_status_in`, increment `toggle_count`.
    - If `toggle_count` reaches 10, send a stop signal through `stop_signal_out` and set `time_advance` to infinity.
  - **Output Function (lambda_out):**
    - Send a stop signal to `stop_signal_out` when `toggle_count` reaches 10.
  - **Confluent Transition Function (delta_conf):**
    - Execute the external transition function and output function if a message arrives at the same time.

### Coupled Model: Root
- This is the coupled model that contains the details about the overall system.
- **Ports:**
  - Input Port: None (as this is the overall system and there is no hierarchy above this.)
  - Output Port: None (as this is the overall system and there is no hierarchy above this.)
- **Internal Couplings:**
  - The output port of the `Light` component is connected to the input port of the `Sensor`.
  - The output port of the `Sensor` component is connected to the input port of the `Controller`.
- **External Couplings:**
  - The `in` port of the `Light-Sensor` coupled model is connected to the input port of the `Controller`.

### Summary of Execution Flow
1. The `Controller` sends on and off signals to the `Light` every second, starting 10 seconds after the simulation begins.
2. The `Light` toggles its state between `on` and `off` and sends the current state to the `Sensor`.
3. The `Sensor` counts the number of toggles and sends a stop signal to the `Controller` after 10 cycles.
4. Upon receiving the stop signal, the `Controller` will turn off the `Light` and stop sending further commands.

### Important Notes
- Ensure that the `time_advance` for the `Light` is properly set to avoid an infinite loop.
- The `Sensor` must not set its `time_advance` to 0 unless it is transitioning to a final state to avoid infinite loops.
- The `lambda` keyword has been avoided in the output function naming.
