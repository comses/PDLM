### Summary of Execution Flow
1. The `Controller1` sends on/off signals at 1-second intervals, `Controller2` at 2 seconds, `Controller3` at 3 seconds, `Controller4` at 4 seconds, and `Controller5` at 5 seconds.
2. Each `Light` component toggles its state based on the received signals.
3. The initial state of all lights is off, and the controllers will start sending signals 10 seconds after the simulation starts.

### Important Notes
- Ensure that the `time_advance` for each `Controller` is properly set to avoid an infinite loop.
- The `Light` components must not set their `time_advance` to 0 unless they are transitioning to avoid infinite loops.
- The `lambda` keyword has been avoided in the output function naming.
