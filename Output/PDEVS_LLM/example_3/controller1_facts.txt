- **ports:**
  - output port: `signal_out`
- **state variables:**
  - `time_advance`: initially set to 0 (to allow immediate transitions).
  - `frequency`: set to 1 (indicating a signal is sent every 1 second).
- **transition functions:**
  - **internal transition function (delta_int):**
    - set `time_advance` to the next scheduled signal time based on `frequency`.
  - **external transition function (delta_ext):**
    - not applicable for this model since it does not receive any messages.
  - **output function (lambda_out):**
    - send an on/off signal to `signal_out` based on the current state.
  - **confluent transition function (delta_conf):**
    - execute the internal transition function and output function if a message arrives at the same time.
