- **ports:**
  - input port: `stop`
  - output port: `out`
- **state variables:**
  - `time_advance`: initially set to 3 (the job generation interval).
  - `job_count`: initially set to 0 (to count the number of jobs generated).
- **transition functions:**
  - **internal transition function (delta_int):**
    - increment `job_count` and prepare to generate the next job.
    - if the `stop` signal is received, set `time_advance` to infinity (to stop generating jobs).
  - **external transition function (delta_ext):**
    - if a stop signal is received at `stop`, set `time_advance` to infinity and transition to a passive state.
  - **output function (lambda_out):**
    - send a job signal to `out` when a job is generated.
  - **confluent transition function (delta_conf):**
    - execute the internal transition function and output function if a stop signal arrives at the same time as the internal transition.
