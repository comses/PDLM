    "content": "You are a StateChart developer using the given detailed Atomic model description. Your goal is to develop the statechart for the behavior of an atomic model using a structured grammar. This grammar is designed to model Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS) components, capturing their states, transitions, and functions. The specification follows a rule-based structure that enables precise and consistent definitions of atomic model behavior. \n\n# Syntax and Semantics\n- The `AtomicModel` class has the attribute `ConfluentType` to define confluent function\n- States in DEVS are defined using four classes - `InitialState`, `State`, `CompositeState`, and `FinalState`\n- `InternalTransition` and `ExternalTransition` classes capture the Internal Transition Fuction and External Transition function, respectively\n- `Transition` class is used to initialize the model which starts from `InitialState`\n- `OutputFunction` class defines the output function of DEVS that just can be added to the `State`. \n\nEach class has the fixed properties associated with them to model the behaviour. \n- `Action` property lists the actions to be taken if the condition from `Guard` property is true.\n- `Guard` property lists the conditions to be met to complete the state transition. If `Guard` property is (\"\") it is to be considered true by default.\n- `Source` property stores the value of the source state of the transition.\n- `Target` property stores the value of the target state of the transition.\n- `TimeAdvanceType` property stores the type of Time Advance amongst Infinity, Update and Value. \n- `TimeAdvanceValue` property stores the value of the Time Advance as float. If `TimeAdvanceType` stores Infinity, then `TimeAdvanceValue` should set to 0.0.\n- `InputPort` property stores the Input port name which triggers the corresponding `ExternalTransition`. \n- `OutputPort` property stores the Output port name which outputs the Message once `InternalTransition` occurs. \n-  `Message` property stores the message to be expected at the `InputPort` in case of `ExternalTransition` class and message to be produced at `OutputPort` in case of `InternalTransition` class. \n- `Description` property stores the description of the parent class. \n\n# Grammar to

`Transition`, `ExternalTransition`, `InternalTransition`) only sets state or time advance or both.\n- You should always follow the standard statechart convetion for the `Guard` and `Action` entrires, i.e ObjectofInterest.\nOperationorFunctiontobePerformed\n    Example:\n    `q.remove()` -> here `q` is the object to perform operation/function on and `remove()` is the operation or function to be performed.\n- Include all the properties in the class. You can leave the empty string (\"\") if that property is not to be used in the class definition. For instance, if a particular transititon only has a `Guard` condition and there is no need to perform any action, then you can store \"\" in `Action` property of the corresponding class.\n- Don't miss to include the model initialization in the `Action` property of the `Transition` class as per model requirements. For instance, in the processor with queue example used queue to hold the jobs, thus the queue is initialized in the `Transition` class through `Action` property\n\nTHINK STEP BY STEP AND ACCURATELY DEFINE CLASSES AND PROPERTIES. MAKE SURE TO FOLLOW THE RESTRICTIONS WITH `Action` PROPERTY CORRECTLY. STRICTLY NO NEED FOR THE EXPLANATION. JUST PROVIDE THE MODEL. NO ADDITIONAL TEXT IS NEEDED."

The `Generator` produces jobs every 3 seconds until a stop signal is received.\n2. The `Processor` processes incoming jobs from the `Generator`, taking 2 seconds for each job.\n3. The `Sensor` counts the processed jobs and sends a stop signal after 5 jobs are processed.\n4. The `Generator` stops generating jobs upon receiving the stop signal from the `Sensor`.\n\n### Important Notes\n- Ensure that the `time_advance` for the `Generator` and `Processor` is properly set to avoid infinite loops.\n- The `Processor` must not set its `time_advance` to 0 unless it is transitioning to `idle` to avoid infinite loops.\n- The `lambda` keyword has been avoided in the output function naming.\n\nCreated atomic models:{'processor': 'Model {\\n    ConfluentType = FET\\n\\n    // States\\n    InitialState { Name = \"start\" }\\n\\n    State { \\n        Name = \"idle\"\\n    }\\n\\n    State { \\n        Name = \"busy\"\\n        OutputFunction {\\n            Action = \"Send processed job signal\"\\n            Description = \"Send a processed job signal to out_1\"\\n            Guard = \"\" \\n            Message = \"ProcessedJob\" \\n            OutputPort = \"out_1\"\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n    // Transitions\\n    Transition {  \\n        Action = \"Initialize job_queue and set time_advance to 2\"\\n        Description = \"Initializing the model\"\\n        Source = \"start\"  \\n        Target = \"idle\" \\n        TimeAdvanceType = Infinity\\n        TimeAdvanceValue = 0.0\\n    }\\n\\n    ExternalTransition {\\n        Action = \"Add job to job_queue, If idle set state to busy and time_advance to 2\"\\n        Description = \"Receiving job at in\"\\n        Guard = \"\"\\n        InputPort = \"in\"\\n        Message = \"JobReceived\"\\n        Source = \"idle\"  \\n        Target = \"busy\"  \\n        TimeAdvanceType = Value\\n        TimeAdvanceValue = 2.0\\n    }\\n\\n    ExternalTransition {\\n        Action = \"Add job to job_queue\"\\n        Description = \"Receiving job at in while busy\"\\n        Guard = \"state=busy\"\\n        InputPort = \"in\"\\n        Message = \"JobReceived\"\\n        Source = \"busy\"  \\n        Target = \"busy\"  \\n        TimeAdvanceType = Value\\n        TimeAdvanceValue = 2.0\\n    }\\n\\n    InternalTransition {\\n        Action = \"If job_queue is empty, change state to idle.
