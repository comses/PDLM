- **ports:**
  - input port: `in`
  - output port: `out`
- **state variables:**
  - `job_count`: initially set to 0 (to count the number of processed jobs).
- **transition functions:**
  - **internal transition function (delta_int):**
    - not applicable as the sensor does not have a periodic internal transition.
  - **external transition function (delta_ext):**
    - increment `job_count` by 1 when a processed job is received at `in`.
    - if `job_count` reaches 5, generate a stop signal on `out`.
  - **output function (lambda_out):**
    - send a stop signal to `out` when `job_count` reaches 5.
  - **confluent transition function (delta_conf):**
    - execute the external transition function if a processed job arrives at the same time as the sensor is already counting.
