Here is the complete system description for the DEVS modelization of the given problem, following the DEVS specifications:

### Coupled Model: Sensor
- This is the coupled model that contains the details about the Sensor.
- **Ports:**
  - Input Port: `feedback_in`
  - Output Port: `feedback_out`
- **Internal Couplings:**
  - The output port of the Sensor is connected to the feedback input of each Controller.
- **External Couplings:**
  - The `feedback_out` port of the Sensor is connected to the `feedback_in` ports of all Controller components.

### Atomic Model: Controller1
- **Ports:**
  - Input Port: `feedback_in`
  - Output Port: `signal_out`
- **State Variables:**
  - `time_advance`: Initially set to 1 (for toggling every second).
  - `state`: Initially set to `off` (indicating the light is off).
  - `toggle_count`: Initially set to 0 (to count the number of toggles).
- **Transition Functions:**
  - **Internal Transition Function (delta_int):**
    - If `state` is `on`, set `state` to `off`.
    - If `state` is `off`, set `state` to `on`.
    - Increment `toggle_count`.
    - Set `time_advance` to 1 (to continue toggling).
  - **External Transition Function (delta_ext):**
    - If a feedback message is received on `feedback_in`, set `state` to `off` and set `time_advance` to infinity (to stop toggling).
  - **Output Function (lambda_out):**
    - Send a signal to `signal_out` when toggling occurs (when transitioning between `on` and `off`).
  - **Confluent Transition Function (delta_conf):**
    - If a feedback message is received while toggling, stop toggling and turn the light off.

### Atomic Model: Controller2
- **Ports:**
  - Input Port: `feedback_in`
  - Output Port: `signal_out`
- **State Variables:**
  - `time_advance`: Initially set to 2 (for toggling every two seconds).
  - `state`: Initially set to `off`.
  - `toggle_count`: Initially set to 0.
- **Transition Functions:**
  - **Internal Transition Function (delta_int):**
    - If `state` is `on`, set `state` to `off`.
    - If `state` is `off`, set `state` to `on`.
    - Increment `toggle_count`.
    - Set `time_advance` to 2.
  - **External Transition Function (delta_ext):**
    - If a feedback message is received on `feedback_in`, set `state` to `off` and set `time_advance` to infinity.
  - **Output Function (lambda_out):**
    - Send a signal to `signal_out` when toggling occurs.
  - **Confluent Transition Function (delta_conf):**
    - If a feedback message is received while toggling, stop toggling and turn the light off.

### Atomic Model: Controller3
- **Ports:**
  - Input Port: `feedback_in`
  - Output Port: `signal_out`
- **State Variables:**
  - `time_advance`: Initially set to 3 (for toggling every three seconds).
  - `state`: Initially set to `off`.
  - `toggle_count`: Initially set to 0.
- **Transition Functions:**
  - **Internal Transition Function (delta_int):**
    - If `state` is `on`, set `state` to `off`.
    - If `state` is `off`, set `state` to `on`.
    - Increment `toggle_count`.
    - Set `time_advance` to 3.
  - **External Transition Function (delta_ext):**
    - If a feedback message is received on `feedback_in`, set `state` to `off` and set `time_advance` to infinity.
  - **Output Function (lambda_out):**
    - Send a signal to `signal_out` when toggling occurs.
  - **Confluent Transition Function (delta_conf):**
    - If a feedback message is received while toggling, stop toggling and turn the light off.

### Coupled Model: Root
- This is the coupled model that contains the details about the overall system.
- **Ports:**
  - Input Port: None (as this is the overall system and there is no hierarchy above this.)
  - Output Port: None (as this is the overall system and there is no hierarchy above this.)
- **Internal Couplings:**
  - The output port of `Controller1` is connected to the input port of the Sensor.
  - The output port of `Controller2` is connected to the input port of the Sensor.
  - The output port of `Controller3` is connected to the input port of the Sensor.
- **External Couplings:**
  - None (as there are no Ports for this coupled model).

### Summary of Execution Flow
1. Each Controller starts toggling its light at 10 seconds after the simulation starts, with frequencies of 1, 2, and 3 seconds respectively.
2. The Sensor counts the total on-off cycles from all Controllers.
3. Once 10 cycles are detected, the Sensor sends feedback to each Controller to stop toggling and turn the lights off.

### Important Notes
- Ensure that the `time_advance` for each Controller is properly set to avoid infinite loops.
- The Controllers must not set their `time_advance` to 0 unless they are transitioning to `off` to avoid infinite loops.
- The `lambda` keyword has been avoided in the output function naming.
