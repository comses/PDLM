- **ports:**
  - input port: `feedback_in`
  - output port: `signal_out`
- **state variables:**
  - `time_advance`: initially set to 1 (for toggling every second).
  - `state`: initially set to `off` (indicating the light is off).
  - `toggle_count`: initially set to 0 (to count the number of toggles).
- **transition functions:**
  - **internal transition function (delta_int):**
    - if `state` is `on`, set `state` to `off`.
    - if `state` is `off`, set `state` to `on`.
    - increment `toggle_count`.
    - set `time_advance` to 1 (to continue toggling).
  - **external transition function (delta_ext):**
    - if a feedback message is received on `feedback_in`, set `state` to `off` and set `time_advance` to infinity (to stop toggling).
  - **output function (lambda_out):**
    - send a signal to `signal_out` when toggling occurs (when transitioning between `on` and `off`).
  - **confluent transition function (delta_conf):**
    - if a feedback message is received while toggling, stop toggling and turn the light off.
